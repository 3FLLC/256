# 256
a Windows/Console (Vector-based,Unicode addressed) True-Type(TTF) Font with full Extended ASCII-8 Support where the old ASCII-7 Spectrum of 128 characters is max-out and Mapped to 256 characters Utilizing Unicode C0 and C1 provisional space instead of the Windows Bitmap-base fonts of windows 95/MS-DOS. There are changes to be made to this charset because glyphs are mapped in other provisional or canonical reserved Unicode addresses/regions which may conflict on a future ASCII+Unicode merged font.
